# Mars' Ionosphere Simulations
Mars' Ionospheric chemical and physical data derived from Fortran code based on actual ionospheric make up and ionospheric make up of two exoplanets (Flared Brown Dwarf / Quiet Brown Dwarf)

The Mephot.f file is a fortran file that is designed Program for the calculation of the photoelectron production energy spectrum, at specified altitudes. This file is a collaborative file created by my colleagues and those before me at the University of Kansas. 

The jpce.f08 file builds upon prior code from a titan project to create a chemical environment for the ionosphere of mars that can be used to derive production rates of ions, combination rates of these ions, and the chemical make up of the ionosphere based on the energies created by these combinations. This file is also a collaborative file created by my colleagues and those before me at the University of Kansas. 


Most of the files are not attached out of privacy of the University of Kansas and my colleagues. This code batch is just to show the data I obtained from my time during research and what I can offer to future employers.

Other than the readme and the two files mentioned above, I have attached the data I collected in graph form of the two exoplanets and base mars. The data I obtained can be categorized in two groups, the production rates and the electron densities wrt the altitudes. All files are labeled accordingly except the production rates for the exoplanets (Quiet, Flare) are at 1 AU and the real brown dwarf data is at .088 AU. These production rates can be seen in .088flare and .088quiet.

PS: The excel files were used to convert data into graphs via python.

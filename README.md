# Mars' Ionosphere Simulations
Mars' Ionospheric chemical and physical data based on Fortran code based on actual ionospheric make up and ionospheric make up of two exoplanets (Flared Brown Dwarf / Quiet Brown Dwarf)

The Mephot.f file is a fortran file that is designed Program for the calculation of the photoelectron production energy spectrum, at specified altitudes. This file is a collaborative file created by my colleagues and those before me at the University of Kansas. 

The jpce.f08 file builds upon prior code from a titan project to create a chemical environment for the ionosphere of mars that can be used to derive production rates of ions, combination rates of these ions, and the chemical make up of the ionosphere based on the energies created by these combinations.

Most of the files are not attached out of privacy of the University of Kansas and my colleagues. This code batch is just to show the data I obtained from my time during research and what I can offer to future employers.

Other than the readme and the two files mentioned above, I have attached the data I collected in graph form of the two exoplanets and base mars. If there are any questions email me at taylorrayeaston@gmail.com or on my linkedin.
